# Smoker Prediction - Data Science Project

Welcome to this repository featuring a comprehensive data science project where we delve into a health insurance dataset. The primary goal is not just to build a prediction model but to optimize it to predict if a person is a smoker or not based on a set of features.

## Objective:

Predict whether a person is a smoker or not based on a set of features and optimize the predictive model for the best performance.

## Dataset:

The dataset consists of the following variables:

- **Age:** Age of primary beneficiary
- **Sex:** Insurance contractor gender, female, male
- **BMI:** Body mass index, providing an understanding of body weights relative to height
- **Children:** Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- **Smoker:** Whether the person is a smoker or not (Target Variable)
- **Region:** The beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest
- **Charges:** Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

You can download the dataset [here](https://example.com).

## Tasks Completed:

- **Data Import:** Imported the dataset into the Jupyter Notebook environment.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted an extensive EDA to understand the underlying relationships between the variables and identify potential predictors for the target variable.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Undertook necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, handling missing or erroneous data, and normalizing numerical variables.

- **Model Building and Evaluation:** Built a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person is a smoker or not. Then evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

- **Model Optimization:** Applied data and modeling techniques learned throughout the course to improve the model's performance.

## Results:

This project demonstrates my competence in data science and machine learning, particularly in building and optimizing predictive models. By employing multiple optimization techniques, I was able to improve the model's performance significantly. You can find the detailed steps and results in the included Jupyter notebook.
