Objective
In this second part of the challenge, you will work on a dataset that
you saw during week 1 but this time with a different perspective. You
will predict whether a person is a smoker or not based on a set of
features. Your goal is not only to build a prediction model but to build a
prediction model in the best possible way. So in this challenge, you
will be building, evaluating, AND improving your model.
Dataset Download here :Insurance Dataset.

The dataset columns are:
❏ age: age of primary beneficiary
❏ sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
❏ bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body,
weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of
height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
❏ children: Number of children covered by health insurance /Number of dependents
❏ smoker: Smoking (TARGET)
❏ region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast,southeast, southwest, northwest.
❏ charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

Expected Work
❏ Import the data in the Notebook Environment.
❏ Run the EDA on the dataset you have.
❏ Preprocess the data before building your model.
❏ Build a Logistic Regression model to predict if a person is a smoker or not and then evaluate the model.
❏ Improve the model you built using Data, Modeling, and Optimization techniques learned during the week!
