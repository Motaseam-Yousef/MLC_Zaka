Objective
The goal of this challenge is to walk you through a case study where
you can apply the deep learning concepts that you learned during the
week. By the end of this challenge, you would have developed a
solution that predicts if a person will have a stroke or not based on
given features using a Deep Learning solution.
DataSet Stroke Dataset This dataset contains information about
people having specific medical conditions (features) and if they
suffered from a stroke or not.

The columns of this dataset are as follows:
❏ id: unique identifier
❏ gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
❏ age: age of the patient
❏ hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
❏ heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
❏ ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
❏ work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
❏ Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
❏ avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
❏ bmi: body mass index
❏ smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
❏ stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not

Expected Work
❏ Import the data in the Notebook Environment.
❏ Do the EDA on your dataset.
❏ Preprocess the data before building your model.
❏ Build a DL model that predicts if a person will have a stroke
given some specific features.
❏ Improve your DL model using some improvements techniques
that you learned about during the week.
