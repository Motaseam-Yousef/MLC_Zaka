# Stroke Prediction - Deep Learning Project

This repository presents an in-depth data science project aimed at predicting if a person will have a stroke based on given features using Deep Learning techniques.

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to develop a Deep Learning solution that predicts whether a person will have a stroke or not based on given features.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains information about people's specific medical conditions and whether they've suffered from a stroke. The features include:

- **id:** Unique identifier
- **gender:** "Male", "Female" or "Other"
- **age:** Age of the patient
- **hypertension:** 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
- **heart_disease:** 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
- **ever_married:** "No" or "Yes"
- **work_type:** "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
- **Residence_type:** "Rural" or "Urban"
- **avg_glucose_level:** Average glucose level in blood
- **bmi:** Body mass index
- **smoking_status:** "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"
- **stroke:** 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not (Target Variable)

## Tasks Completed:

- **Data Import:** Imported the dataset into the Jupyter Notebook environment.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted extensive EDA to comprehend the relationships among variables and identify potential predictors of stroke.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Undertook the necessary preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling numerical variables.

- **Model Building:** Built a Deep Learning model using Keras/Tensorflow to predict if a person will have a stroke given specific features.

- **Model Improvement:** Employed advanced techniques and strategies to improve the performance of the deep learning model.

## Results:

This project showcases my proficiency in deep learning and data science, particularly in building, evaluating, and improving deep learning models. The model was systematically improved to enhance prediction performance. You can find the detailed steps and results in the included Jupyter notebook.
