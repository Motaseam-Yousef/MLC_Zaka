# Loan Approval Prediction - Data Science Assignment

Welcome to this repository containing a comprehensive data science assignment where we explore a loan dataset, follow the Data Science Lifecycle steps, and build a simple machine learning model to predict loan approval based on various features. 

## Objective:

Explore the loan dataset and build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on the individual's features.

## Dataset:

The dataset consists of various variables:

- **Loan_ID:** Unique ID in the dataset
- **Gender:** Individual's gender
- **Married:** Individual's marital status
- **Dependents:** Number of dependents
- **Education:** Individual's education status
- **Self_Employed:** Individual's employment status
- **ApplicantIncome:** Individual's income
- **CoapplicantIncome:** Co-applicant's income
- **LoanAmount:** Loan amount in thousands
- **Loan_Amount_Term:** Term of loan in months
- **Credit_History:** Whether the credit history meets guidelines
- **Property_Area:** Urban/Semi Urban/Rural
- **Loan_Status:** Whether the loan was approved (Y/N) - *Target variable*

## Tasks Completed:

- **Data Import:** Imported the data into the Jupyter Notebook environment for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted an in-depth EDA to understand the dataset's variables, relationships, and potential predictors.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Performed necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

- **Model Building and Validation:** Built and validated a Logistic Regression model to predict the approval status of a loan based on given features.

- **Feature Importance:** Determined the feature importance in the resultant model, shedding light on the variables most predictive of loan approval.

## Results:

This assignment showcases my proficiency in data science lifecycle steps and my ability to build an effective logistic regression model. You can view the detailed steps and outcomes in the Jupyter notebook included in this repository.
