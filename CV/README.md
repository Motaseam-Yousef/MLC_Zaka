# Face Mask Detection - Computer Vision Project

This repository contains a comprehensive project on predicting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not based on provided images. It showcases the application of Computer Vision concepts and interaction with Kaggle via API.

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts whether a person is wearing a face mask given an image. An additional objective is to learn how to use the Kaggle API to directly download datasets into the Google Colab or Google Drive environment.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://example.com). It contains images of individuals with and without face masks. During the project, we work with a subset of the full dataset.

## Tasks Completed:

- **Dataset Import:** Imported the dataset into the Colab environment using Kaggle's API.

- **Dataset Understanding:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the nature and structure of the dataset.

- **Model Building:** Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict if a person is wearing a face mask based on the provided images.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

- **Error Analysis:** Performed error analysis to understand the model's shortcomings and areas of improvement.

- **Model Improvement:** Improved the model by employing various techniques such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and employing more complex architectures.

## Results:

This project highlights my skills in computer vision, deep learning, and working with APIs. The model was systematically built, evaluated, and improved, leading to a robust face mask detection model. Detailed steps and results can be found in the included Jupyter notebook.
